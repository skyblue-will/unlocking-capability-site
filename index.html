        <h1>Unlocking Capability</h1>
        <p class="byline">By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willpalmeruk/">Will Palmer</a></p>
        
        <p class="lede">The product is not the UI. It never was.</p>
        
        <p>User interfaces are cognitive prosthetics. They offload executive function, organise information visually, provide a preference layer into underlying data. The screen, the button, the form field: accommodations for how human minds work.</p>
        
        <p>What was always underneath: the data model, the business logic, the API. The capability layer.</p>
        
        <p>Agents don't need the accommodation. They mainline into APIs, CLIs, databases. This reveals something that was always true but easy to miss: the interface was never the product. It was the wrapper.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Post-Product</h2>
        
        <p>SaaS products bundle three things: capability (what it does), data (what it knows), and interface (how humans access it). Companies competed on how well they executed the bundle.</p>
        
        <p>In a world where agents access capability directly and generate interfaces on demand, the bundle falls apart.</p>
        
        <p>The capability layer is what remains. APIs, data models, business logic. The stuff that actually does things, stripped of any particular human interface.</p>
        
        <p>UIs become ephemeral. Generated when a human needs one. Dissolved when they're done. Not designed once and shipped, but conjured on demand.</p>
        
        <p>This isn't theoretical. I run agents that manage websites, coordinate tasks, and interact with customers — all through capability layers. I still build interfaces, but they're tools for me: shaped to how my brain works, so I can collaborate with the agents effectively. They're not products to be shipped. They're cognitive prosthetics for one person.</p>
        
        <p>And there is no settled "product." As the time between intent and execution collapses, what exists is constantly reshaped — an evolving system of capability layers, personal interfaces, and agent orchestration. You don't ship and maintain. You direct and evolve.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Planning Permission and Building Regulations</h2>
        
        <p>When capability is democratised — when anyone with the right mental models can build — the bottleneck moves. It's no longer "can we build this?" It's "should we, and how do we keep it safe?" Governance becomes the critical question. Two questions:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Who can build?</strong> That's planning permission. A human with authority looks at what you want to build and says yes or no. It's a judgment call — context, trust, accountability. This stays human. It has to.</p>
        
        <p><strong>How should they build?</strong> That's building regulations. Standards that are encoded, testable, enforceable. The API won't accept what isn't permitted. The deployment won't pass if the standards aren't met. But the standards themselves are written by humans — reviewed, debated, updated as the landscape changes. Like a constitution, they need ongoing oversight. No one is letting AI write the regulations. The system enforces them. Humans govern them.</p>
        
        <p>Traditional governance tried to handle both with policy documents. It rarely worked — documents get ignored, and humans can't enforce consistency at scale. Encoding the regulations into the system itself means compliance is automatic. That frees human judgment for the decisions that actually need it: what to allow, and what to block.</p>
        
        <p>But neither planning permission nor building regulations answer the critical question:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Is what was built actually safe?</strong></p>
        
        <p>This is where human oversight concentrates. Not spread across every decision — that's bureaucracy, and it kills velocity. Concentrated where it matters: security review, red teaming, pen testing, auditing. The work that requires adversarial thinking, contextual judgment, and the willingness to try to break what was just built.</p>
        
        <p>Automated systems play a crucial role here — not replacing the humans, but routing work to them. An LLM can audit a codebase and flag what needs attention. Automated checks can enforce the building regulations. But the security layer needs human eyes, because the failure modes are emergent. You can't write a regulation for an attack that hasn't been invented yet.</p>
        
        <p>This is what unlocks capability without the wild west. Not bureaucracy. Not a free-for-all. An agile security layer where automated systems surface what matters and humans concentrate their judgment where it counts.</p>
        
        <p>The AI builds. The human secures. That's the full unlock.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>The Trust Gradient</h2>
        
        <p>This creates a new stratification. Not "technical" versus "non-technical," but a gradient of trust:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Operators</strong> work within capability layers others have built. They're trusted to use the system, not to change it. The building regulations protect them from doing damage; the planning permission was granted to someone else.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Builders</strong> shape the capability layer. They add endpoints, modify constraints, extend what's possible. They've earned planning permission for their domain. The system still enforces the building regulations around them.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Architects</strong> design the system itself. They set the building regulations that everyone else works within. They decide what the constraints are.</p>
        
        <p>This isn't a clean hierarchy. Someone might be an architect in one domain and an operator in another. The gradient is continuous and contextual.</p>
        
        <p>What earns movement up? The same messy human factors as always: demonstrated trust, track record, necessity.</p>
        
        <p>But the feedback loop is faster now. When the gap between intent and execution shrinks, incompetence becomes visible quickly. So does competence. The gradient sorts itself faster than any org chart ever could.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>What Building Means Now</h2>
        
        <p>If agents write the code, what does a builder actually do?</p>
        
        <p>The shift is from procedural to conceptual. Not "how do I write this syntax" but "what exists in the solution space."</p>
        
        <p>A builder needs to know that migrations exist as a concept, that SQL injection is a threat category, that APIs have authentication. They don't need to implement these things. They need to know they're the things to ask for.</p>
        
        <p>This makes computer science more important, not less. Not the syntax of any particular language, but the mental models: state, concurrency, authentication versus authorisation, idempotency, race conditions.</p>
        
        <p>Vocabulary becomes leverage. "Test for SQL injection" and "create a migration" are precise instructions that produce precise outcomes. Someone without those concepts can't access the same capability.</p>
        
        <p>But this isn't about learning a glossary. Knowing the word "idempotency" is useless. Knowing <em>why</em> a retry might corrupt your data — that's the literacy that matters. The shift isn't from code to words. It's from syntax to judgment about systems.</p>
        
        <p>And that <em>is</em> teachable. Not as a word list, but as mental models.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>The Pioneer Problem</h2>
        
        <p>Right now, trust is personal. Leadership trusts <em>me</em> because of track record and judgment.</p>
        
        <p>But this doesn't scale. When you want to empower more people, people without that track record, you can't rely on individual judgment. The planning permission process needs to be formalised. The building regulations need to be encoded. The system needs to be safe for people who aren't pioneers.</p>
        
        <p>Pioneers build the path. Others will walk it. The path needs to be safe even for those without the pioneer's footing.</p>
        
        <p>There's always a frontier, though. Encode one edge, the frontier moves. Humans lead at the edge. The system crystallises yesterday's judgments; humans make tomorrow's.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>The Unlocking</h2>
        
        <p>The capability is already there. The models are powerful enough. The APIs exist. The cost is collapsing.</p>
        
        <p>What's missing is the governance: who gets planning permission, what the building regulations enforce, and who verifies that what was built is safe. Solve that, and you unlock capability for everyone — not just the pioneers.</p>
        
        <p>The organisations that move first won't be the ones with the best AI. They'll be the ones that learn to separate permission from regulation, trust humans with the first, and encode the second into their systems.</p>
