        <h1>Unlocking Capability</h1>
        <p class="byline">By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willpalmeruk/">Will Palmer</a></p>
        
        <p class="lede">The product is not the UI. It never was.</p>
        
        <p>The product is the capability: the data model, the business logic, the API. The UI was just a delivery mechanism for humans who couldn't access capability directly.</p>
        
        <p>Agents don't need that delivery mechanism. They mainline into APIs, CLIs, databases. The visual layer adds nothing for them.</p>
        
        <p>This changes everything about how we build, who can build, and what "product" even means.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>The Human Accommodation</h2>
        
        <p>User interfaces exist because humans need them. A UI is a cognitive prosthetic. It offloads executive function, organises information visually, provides a preference interface into underlying data. The screen, the button, the form field: accommodations for how human minds work.</p>
        
        <p>Agents don't need this accommodation. This reveals something that was always true but easy to miss: the interface was never the product. It was the wrapper.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Post-Product</h2>
        
        <p>I've been talking about "post-product" for nearly a year. Here's what it actually means.</p>
        
        <p>SaaS products bundle three things: capability (what it does), data (what it knows), and interface (how humans access it). Companies competed on how well they executed the bundle.</p>
        
        <p>In a world where agents access capability directly and generate interfaces on demand, the bundle falls apart.</p>
        
        <p>The capability layer becomes the product. Or rather, what replaces it. APIs, data models, business logic. The stuff that actually does things, stripped of any particular human interface.</p>
        
        <p>UIs become ephemeral. Generated when a human needs one. Dissolved when they're done. Not designed once and shipped, but conjured on demand.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Planning Permission and Building Regulations</h2>
        
        <p>If the capability layer is the new foundation, governance becomes the critical question. Think of it like property development. Two questions:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Who can build?</strong> That's planning permission. A human with authority looks at what you want to build and says yes or no. It's a judgment call — context, trust, accountability. This stays human. It has to.</p>
        
        <p><strong>How should they build?</strong> That's building regulations. Standards that are encoded, testable, enforceable. The API won't accept what isn't permitted. The deployment won't pass if the standards aren't met. The system enforces this, not a policy document people ignore.</p>
        
        <p>The human decides what's allowed. The system enforces how it's done. Traditional governance tried to do both with documents. It rarely worked. Separating the two makes both stronger.</p>
        
        <p>But there's a third question that neither planning permission nor building regulations can answer:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Is what was built actually safe?</strong></p>
        
        <p>An LLM can audit a codebase and catch most issues. Automated checks give confidence. But until a human tries to break in — pen testing, red teaming, security auditing — you don't know. Automated checks give confidence. Human verification gives certainty.</p>
        
        <p>The AI builds. The human secures. That's the full unlock.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>The Trust Gradient</h2>
        
        <p>This creates a new stratification. Not "technical" versus "non-technical," but a gradient of trust:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Operators</strong> work within capability layers others have built. They're trusted to use the system, not to change it. The building regulations protect them from doing damage; the planning permission was granted to someone else.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Builders</strong> shape the capability layer. They add endpoints, modify constraints, extend what's possible. They've earned planning permission for their domain. The system still enforces the building regulations around them.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Architects</strong> design the system itself. They set the building regulations that everyone else works within. They decide what the constraints are.</p>
        
        <p>This isn't a clean hierarchy. Someone might be an architect in one domain and an operator in another. The gradient is continuous and contextual.</p>
        
        <p>What earns movement up? The same messy human factors as always: demonstrated trust, track record, expedient need. But the feedback loop is faster now. Incompetence becomes visible quickly because the gap between intent and execution shrinks.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>What Building Means Now</h2>
        
        <p>If agents write the code, what does a builder actually do?</p>
        
        <p>The shift is from procedural to conceptual. Not "how do I write this syntax" but "what exists in the solution space."</p>
        
        <p>A builder needs to know that migrations exist as a concept, that SQL injection is a threat category, that APIs have authentication. They don't need to implement these things. They need to know they're the things to ask for.</p>
        
        <p>This makes computer science more important, not less. Not the syntax of any particular language, but the mental models: state, concurrency, authentication versus authorisation, idempotency, race conditions.</p>
        
        <p>Vocabulary becomes leverage. "Test for SQL injection" and "create a migration" are precise instructions that produce precise outcomes. Someone without those concepts can't access the same capability.</p>
        
        <p>But this isn't about learning a glossary. Knowing the word "idempotency" is useless. Knowing <em>why</em> a retry might corrupt your data — that's the literacy that matters. The shift isn't from code to words. It's from syntax to judgment about systems.</p>
        
        <p>And that <em>is</em> teachable. Not as a word list, but as a way of seeing.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>The Pioneer Problem</h2>
        
        <p>Right now, trust is personal. Leadership trusts <em>me</em> because of track record and judgment.</p>
        
        <p>But this doesn't scale. When you want to empower more people, people without that track record, you can't rely on individual judgment. The planning permission process needs to be formalised. The building regulations need to be encoded. The system needs to be safe for people who aren't pioneers.</p>
        
        <p>Pioneers build the path. Others will walk it. The path needs to be safe even for those without the pioneer's footing.</p>
        
        <p>There's always a frontier, though. Encode one edge, the frontier moves. Humans lead at the edge. The system crystallises yesterday's judgments; humans make tomorrow's.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>The Unlocking</h2>
        
        <p>The capability is there to be unlocked. The question is who unlocks it, and under what terms.</p>
        
        <p>The people who thrive will be the ones who develop the vocabulary to direct capability, the judgment to grant permission wisely, and the discipline to encode the right constraints.</p>
        
        <p>The organisations that thrive will be the ones that separate planning permission from building regulations, trust humans with the first, and encode the second into their systems.</p>
        
        <p>The capability layer is the new foundation. Build on it, or be built upon.</p>
